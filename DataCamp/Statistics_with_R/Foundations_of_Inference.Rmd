### Introduction to Ideas of Inference
Making inferential claims (as opposed to descriptive) about the data  
**Statistical Inference**: The process of making claims about a population based on information from a sample.

**Vocabulary**:  

* **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: the claim that is not interesting. e.g. there is no statistical difference between two sample groups
* **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_A$)**: the claim corresponding to the research hypothesis
* **Goal**: prove that the alternative hypothesis is true and the null is false.
* **Example 1**: Comparing the speed of two different subspecies of cheetah
  + $H_0$: Asian and African cheetahs run at the same average speed
  + $H_A$: there is a statistically significant difference between the average running pace of Asian and African cheetahs
* **Example 2**: From a sample, researchers would like to claim that Candidate X will win an election
  + $H_0$: Candidate X will get half the votes
  + $H_A$: Candidate X will get more than half the votes
  
#### Randomized Distributions

Understanding the Null Distribution  
Generating a distribution of the statistic from the null population gives information about whether the observed data are inconsistent with the null hypothesis.  

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
soda %>%
  group_by( location ) %>%
  summarize( prop_cola = mean( drink == 'cola' ) ) %>%
  summarize( diff( prop_cola ) )

soda %>%
  specify( drink ~ location, success = 'cola' ) %>%
  hypothesize( null = 'independence' ) %>%
  generate( reps = 1, type = 'permute' ) %>%
  calculate( stat = 'diff in props',
             order = c( 'west', 'east' ) )
```
Repeat the sampling several times:
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
soda %>%
  specify( drink ~ location, success = 'cola' ) %>%
  hypothesize( null = 'independence' ) %>%
  generate( reps = 5, type = 'permute' ) %>%
  calculate( stat = 'diff in props',
             order = c( 'west', 'east' ) )
```
Repeat the sampling and calculations enough times to generate a distribution:
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
soda %>%
  specify( drink ~ location, success = 'cola' ) %>%
  hypothesize( null = 'independence' ) %>%
  generate( reps = 100, type = 'permute' ) %>%
  calculate( stat = 'diff in props',
             order = c( 'west', 'east' ) )
```

```{r}
colnames( NHANES )
```
```{r}
# Create bar plot for Home Ownership by Gender
ggplot(NHANES, aes(x = Gender, fill = HomeOwn)) + 
  # Set the position to fill
  geom_bar(position = 'fill') +
  ylab("Relative frequencies")
```
```{r}
# Density plot of SleepHrsNight colored by SleepTrouble
ggplot(NHANES, aes(x = SleepHrsNight, color = SleepTrouble)) + 
  # Adjust by 2
  geom_density(adjust = 2) + 
  # Facet by HealthGen
  facet_wrap(~ HealthGen)
```

Investigate the relationship between gender and home ownership

Calculate the original observed statistic
```{r}
homes <- NHANES %>%
  # Select Gender and HomeOwn
  select(Gender, HomeOwn) %>%
  # Filter for HomeOwn equal to "Own" or "Rent"
  filter(HomeOwn %in% c("Own", "Rent"))

glimpse( homes )
```
Find the observed differences in proportions of home ownerships between the genders
```{r message = FALSE}
diff_orig <- homes %>%   
  # Group by gender
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  # Summarize proportion of homeowners
  summarize(prop_own = mean( HomeOwn == 'Own')) %>%
  # Summarize difference in proportion of homeowners
  summarize(obs_diff_prop = diff(prop_own)) # male - female
  
# See the result
diff_orig
```
Randomize the data under the null model of independence
```{r}
# Specify variables
homeown_perm <- homes %>%
  specify(HomeOwn ~ Gender, success = "Own") %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence")  %>% 
  generate(reps = 100, type = "permute") %>% 
  calculate(stat = 'diff in props', order = c( 'male','female' ))

# Print results to console
homeown_perm

# Dotplot of 100 permuted differences in proportions
ggplot(homeown_perm, aes(x = stat)) + 
  geom_dotplot(binwidth = 0.001)
```
Try permuting 1000x and visualize the distribution as a density plot:
```{r}
# Perform 1000 permutations
homeown_perm <- homes %>%
  # Specify HomeOwn vs. Gender, with `"Own" as success
  specify(HomeOwn ~ Gender, success = "Own") %>%
  # Use a null hypothesis of independence
  hypothesize(null = 'independence') %>% 
  # Generate 1000 repetitions (by permutation)
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% 
  # Calculate the difference in proportions (male then female)
  calculate(stat = 'diff in props', order = c('male','female'))

# Density plot of 1000 permuted differences in proportions
ggplot(homeown_perm, aes(x = stat)) + 
  geom_density()
```
The distribution is approximately normally distributed around ~-0.01, but what can we conclude from this finding?....

**Four Steps of Inference**:  

1. `specify`: will specify the response and explanatory variables
2. `hypothesize`: will declare the null hypothesis
3. `generate`: will generate resamples, permutations, or simulations
4. `calculate`: will calculate summary statistics

#### Using the Randomization Distribution
Comparing the observed statistic against a distribution of the null hypothesis.
Quantify how different the observed is...

```{r message = FALSE}
soda %>%
  group_by( location ) %>%
  summarize( prop_cola = mean( drink == 'cola' ) ) %>%
  summarize( diff( prop_cola ) ) %>%
  pull()

soda %>%
  specify( drink ~ location, success = 'cola' ) %>%
  hypothesize( null = 'independence' ) %>%
  generate( reps = 100, type = 'permute' ) %>%
  calculate( stat = 'diff in props',
             order = c( 'west', 'east' ) )

#how many permutation stats are greater than or equal to the observed stat
soda_perm %>%
  summarize( proportion = mean( diff_orig >= stat )) 
```

```{r}
glimpse( homeown_perm )
# Plot permuted differences, diff_perm
ggplot(homeown_perm, aes(x = stat)) + 
  # Add a density layer
  geom_density() +
  # Add a vline layer with intercept diff_orig
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = diff_orig$obs_diff_prop), color = "red")

# Compare permuted differences to observed difference
homeown_perm %>%
  mutate( diff_orig = diff_orig$obs_diff_prop ) %>%
  summarize(n_perm_le_obs = sum(stat <= diff_orig))
```
Here we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is no evidence that our data are inconsistent with the null hypothesis that there is no difference between homeownership between genders.  


### Completing a Randomization Test: Gender Dicrimination
Here we will complete a full hypothesis test  
data from [Influence of sex role stereotypes on personnel decisions](http://fcrstemalgebra1.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/82019231/1e.%20Sex%20role%20stereotypes.pdf)

$H_0$: gender and promotion are unrelated variables  
$H_A$: men are more likely to be promoted

```{r}
disc <- data.frame( promote = c( rep( 'promoted', 35 ), rep( 'not_promoted', 13 )),
                    sex = c( rep( 'male', 21 ), rep( 'female', 14 ),
                             rep( 'male', 3), rep( 'female', 10 )))
disc %>%
  group_by( sex ) %>%
  summarize( promoted_prop = mean( promote == 'promoted' ))
```
Is it plausible to observe such a difference in proportions if the null hypothesis is true?
How big of a difference does there have to be?

```{r message = FALSE }
# Create a contingency table summarizing the data
disc %>%
  # Count the rows by sex, promote
  count( sex, promote)

# Find proportion of each sex who were promoted
disc %>%
  # Group by sex
  group_by( sex ) %>%
  # Calculate proportion promoted summary stat
  summarize( promoted_prop = mean( promote == 'promoted'))
```
The difference in prportions is ~0.3  

```{r}
# Replicate the entire data frame, permuting the promote variable
disc_perm <- disc %>%
  specify(promote ~ sex, success = "promoted") %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 5, type = "permute")

disc_perm %>%
  # Group by replicate
  group_by( replicate ) %>%
  # Count per group
  count()

disc_perm %>%
  # Calculate difference in proportion, male then female
  calculate( stat = 'diff in props', order = c( 'male','female'))
```

calculate the observed difference:
```{r}
# Calculate the observed difference in promotion rate
diff_orig <- disc %>%
  # Group by sex
  group_by(sex) %>%
  # Summarize to calculate fraction promoted
  summarize(prop_prom = mean(promote == 'promoted')) %>%
  # Summarize to calculate difference
  summarize(stat = diff(prop_prom)) %>% 
  pull()
    
# See the result
diff_orig
```


create a randomized distribution of the null statistic
```{r}
# Create data frame of permuted differences in promotion rates
disc_perm <- disc %>%
  # Specify promote vs. sex
  specify(promote ~ sex, success = "promoted") %>%
  # Set null hypothesis as independence
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  # Generate 1000 permutations
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  # Calculate difference in proportions
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("male", "female"))

glimpse( disc_perm )
```

Visualize the simulation
```{r}
# Using permutation data, plot stat
ggplot(disc_perm, aes(x = stat)) + 
  # Add a histogram layer
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  # Add a vertical line at diff_orig
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = diff_orig), color = "red")
```

#### Distribution of Statistics
We are interested in whether the observed statistic is different from values obtained by shuffling. can use:  

* Difference in proportions: $\hat{p}-p$
* Ratio: $\frac{\hat{p}}{p}$

Calculating quantiles  
```{r}
disc_perm %>%
  summarize( q.05 = quantile( stat, p = 0.05),
             q.95 = quantile( stat, p = 0.95))
```
The observed statistic is greater than the upper limit quantile supporting the idea that the observed data is not consistent with the bulk of the null distribution.

#### Why 0.05?

"It is a common practice to judge a result significant, if it is of such a magnitude that it would have been produced by chance not more frequently than once in twenty trials. This is **an arbitrary**, but convenient, level of significance for the practical investigator, but it does not mean that he allows himself to be deceived one in every twenty experiments. The test of significance only tells him what to ignore, namely all experiments in which significant results are not obtained. He should only claim that a phenomenon is experimentally demonstrable when he knows how to design an experiment so that it will rarely fail to give a significant result. Consequently, isolated significant results which he does not know how to reproduce are left in suspense pending further investigation." 

0.05 is about the same odds as flipping 5 heads in a row with a coin.  

Degree of skepticism: using a cutoff of 0.05 is more skeptical of the observed result  

A cutoff level is subjective. Only significant results from well designed studies should lead to further investigation.  

How does the sample size of the randomization null distribution matter:
```{r}
disc_small <- data.frame( promote = c( rep( 'promoted', 12 ), rep( 'not_promoted', 4 )),
                    sex = c( rep( 'male', 7 ), rep( 'female', 5 ),
                             rep( 'male', 1), rep( 'female', 3 )))

disc_big <- data.frame( promote = c( rep( 'promoted', 350 ), rep( 'not_promoted', 130 )),
                    sex = c( rep( 'male', 210 ), rep( 'female', 140 ),
                             rep( 'male', 30), rep( 'female', 100 )))

# Tabulate the small dataset
disc_small %>% 
  # Select sex and promote
  count(sex, promote)

  
# Do the same for disc_big
disc_big %>% 
  # Select sex and promote
  count(sex, promote)
```
```{r}
# Create data frame of permuted differences in promotion rates
disc_perm_small <- disc_small %>%
  # Specify promote vs. sex
  specify(promote ~ sex, success = "promoted") %>%
  # Set null hypothesis as independence
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  # Generate 1000 permutations
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  # Calculate difference in proportions
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("male", "female"))


# Create data frame of permuted differences in promotion rates
disc_perm_big <- disc_big %>%
  # Specify promote vs. sex
  specify(promote ~ sex, success = "promoted") %>%
  # Set null hypothesis as independence
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  # Generate 1000 permutations
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  # Calculate difference in proportions
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("male", "female"))

```

calculate the observed difference:
```{r}
# Calculate the observed difference in promotion rate
diff_orig_small <- disc_small %>%
  # Group by sex
  group_by(sex) %>%
  # Summarize to calculate fraction promoted
  summarize(prop_prom = mean(promote == 'promoted')) %>%
  # Summarize to calculate difference
  summarize(stat = diff(prop_prom)) %>% 
  pull()
    
diff_orig_big <- disc_big %>%
  # Group by sex
  group_by(sex) %>%
  # Summarize to calculate fraction promoted
  summarize(prop_prom = mean(promote == 'promoted')) %>%
  # Summarize to calculate difference
  summarize(stat = diff(prop_prom)) %>% 
  pull()
```

visualize
```{r}
# Using disc_perm_small, plot stat
sm <- ggplot(disc_perm_small, aes(x = stat)) + 
  # Add a histogram layer with binwidth 0.01
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  # Add a vline layer, crossing x-axis at diff_orig_small
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = diff_orig_small), color = "red")

# Swap the dataset to disc_perm_big
bg <- ggplot(disc_perm_big, aes(x = stat)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.01) +
  # Change the x-axis intercept to diff_orig_big
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = diff_orig_big), color = "red")

grid.arrange( sm, bg, ncol = 2 )
```

```{r}
calc_upper_quantiles <- function(dataset) {
  dataset %>% 
    summarize(
      q.90 = quantile(stat, p = 0.90),
      q.95 = quantile(stat, p = 0.95),
      q.99 = quantile(stat, p = 0.99)
    )
}


# Calculate the quantiles associated with the small dataset
calc_upper_quantiles(disc_perm_small)

# Calculate the quantiles associated with the big dataset
calc_upper_quantiles(disc_perm_big)
```

#### What is a p-value?
**p-value**: the probability of observing data as or more extreme than what we actually got given that the null hypothesis is true.

Visualize and Calculate p-values:
```{r}
# Visualize and calculate the p-value for the small dataset
disc_perm_small %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = diff_orig_small, direction = "greater")

disc_perm_small %>%
  visualize(obs_stat = diff_orig_small, direction = "greater")

# Visualize and calculate the p-value for the big dataset
disc_perm_big %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = diff_orig_big, direction = "greater")

disc_perm_big %>%
  visualize(obs_stat = diff_orig_big, direction = "greater")
```
The result is very consistent with the small dataset (p-value = 0.277 ) and extremely unusual for the large dataset (p-value = 0)

Does the difference in promotion rates still appear to be statistically significant for this new data?
```{r}
disc_new <- data.frame( promote = c( rep( 'promoted', 35 ), rep( 'not_promoted', 13 )),
                    sex = c( rep( 'male', 18 ), rep( 'female', 17 ),
                             rep( 'male', 6), rep( 'female', 7 )))

# Tabulate the new data
disc_new %>%
count( sex, promote )
```

```{r}
# Create data frame of permuted differences in promotion rates
disc_perm_new <- disc_new %>%
  # Specify promote vs. sex
  specify(promote ~ sex, success = "promoted") %>%
  # Set null hypothesis as independence
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  # Generate 1000 permutations
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  # Calculate difference in proportions
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("male", "female"))

diff_orig_new <- disc_new %>%
  # Group by sex
  group_by(sex) %>%
  # Summarize to calculate fraction promoted
  summarize(prop_prom = mean(promote == 'promoted')) %>%
  # Summarize to calculate difference
  summarize(stat = diff(prop_prom)) %>% 
  pull()

# Plot the distribution of the new permuted differences
ggplot(disc_perm_new, aes(x = stat)) + 
  geom_histogram() +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = diff_orig_new), color = "red")
```
find the p-values of the new dataset:
```{r}
# Find the p-value from the new data
disc_perm_new %>%
  summarize(p_value = mean(diff_orig_new <= stat))
```
