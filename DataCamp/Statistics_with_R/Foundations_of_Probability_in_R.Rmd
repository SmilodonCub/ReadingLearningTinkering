### The Binomial Distribution

#### Flipping Coins in `R`

Simulating a coin flip in `R` with `rbinom( numdraws, numcoins, prob(1) )` 
```{r}
#the rbinom() function:
rbinom( 1,1,.5 )
```
Flipping many coins:
```{r}
#returns a vector of flips
rbinom( 10,1,0.5 )
```
```{r}
#return the sum of heads (1) from the flips
rbinom( 1,10,0.5 )
```
```{r}
#return a vector of sums of multiple multi coin flip outcomes
rbinom( 10,10,0.5 )
```

Unfair coin tosses:
```{r}
rbinom( 10,10,0.8 )
rbinom( 10,10,0.2 )
```

Binomial Distributions
$$X_{1 \cdots n} \sim \mbox{Binomial}(\mbox{size},p)$$

```{r}
# Generate 100 occurrences of flipping 10 coins, each with 30% probability
manyflips <- data.frame( tenflipssum = rbinom(100000,10,0.3) )
ggplot( manyflips, aes( x = tenflipssum ) ) +
  geom_bar( binwidth = 1 ) +
  scale_x_continuous( limits = c( 1,10 )) +
  ggtitle( 'Flipping 10 coins many times' )
```


#### Density and Cumulatice Density

What is the probability that the sum of 10 flips will be 5?
$$P(flips=5)$$
```{r}
flips <- data.frame( flip10 = rbinom( 100000,10,0.3 ) )
ggplot( flips, aes( x = flip10 ) ) +
  geom_histogram()
```
There were ~25000 flips of 10 with a sum of 5. 
$$\sim \frac{25000}{100000} = \frac{1}{4}$$
We can easily get the exact number:
```{r}
mean( flips$flip10 == 5 )
```

Calculating the exact probability density:
dbinom( outcome to find estimate at, the number of coins, the probability of heads )
```{r}
#probability at 5 for a fair coin
dbinom( 5, 10, 0.5 )

#probability at 6 for a fair coin
dbinom( 6, 10, 0.5 )

#probability at 10 for a fair coin
dbinom( 10, 10, 0.5 )
```

**Cumulative Density**  
the probability that the outcome is $\gt,\lt,\geq,\leq$ a point on the probability outcomes distribution.
$$X \sim \mbox{Binomial}(10,.5)$$
$$Pr(X \leq 4 )$$
programatically calculate the simulated probability:
```{r}
mean( flips <= 4 )
```
use the function `pbinom()` to find the exactvalue
```{r}
pbinom( 4, 10, 0.5 )
```

```{r}
# Calculate the probability that 2 of 10 coins are heads using dbinom
dbinom( 2, 10, 0.3 )
# Confirm your answer with a simulation using rbinom
mean( rbinom( 10000, 10, 0.3 ) == 2 )
```
```{r}
# Calculate the probability that at least five coins are heads
pbinom( 5, 10, 0.3 )

# Confirm your answer with a simulation of 10,000 trials
mean( rbinom( 10000, 10, 0.3 ) >= 5 )
```


#### Expected Value and Variance

Properties of a distribution:  

* **Expected Value**: Where is the distribution centered? (mean value)
  + $E[X] = \mbox{size}\cdot p$
* **Variance**: How spread out is it?
  + $\mbox{Var}(X) = \mbox{size} \cdot p \cdot (1-p)$

```{r}
#find the expected value:
flips <- rbinom( 100000, 10, .5 )
mean( flips )

mean( rbinom( 100000, 100, 0.2 ) )
```
```{r}
#calculate the variance
var( flips )
```

```{r}
#What is the expected value of a binomial distribution where 25 coins are flipped, each having a 30% chance of heads?

# Calculate the expected value using the exact formula
25*.3

# Confirm with a simulation using rbinom
mean(rbinom(10000,25,.3))

# Calculate the variance using the exact formula
25*.3*(1-.3)

# Confirm with a simulation using rbinom
var(rbinom(10000,25,.3))
```


### Laws of Probability

#### Probability of Event A & Event B
The probability of A & B is the P(A)*P(B):
$$\mbox{Pr}( A \mbox{ and } B ) = \mbox{Pr}( A ) \cdot \mbox{Pr}( B )$$
```{r}
treeDiag(c("Event A","Event B"),
         c(0.5, 0.5), list(c(0.5, 0.5), c(0.5, 0.5)))
```
Simulate this by collecting data on lots of coin flips
```{r}
#collect 100000 trials of two coin flips
A <- rbinom( 100000, 1, 0.5 )
B <- rbinom( 100000,1, 0.5 )
#compare results from the two coins to see how many trials resulted in 2 heads
mean( A & B )
```
another example with unequal probabilities
```{r}
# Simulate 100,000 flips of a coin with a 40% chance of heads
A <- rbinom(100000, 1, 0.4)

# Simulate 100,000 flips of a coin with a 20% chance of heads
B <- rbinom(100000, 1, 0.2)

# Estimate the probability both A and B are heads
mean( A & B )
```
using multiple events
```{r}
# You've already simulated 100,000 flips of coins A and B
A <- rbinom(100000, 1, .4)
B <- rbinom(100000, 1, .2)

# Simulate 100,000 flips of coin C (70% chance of heads)
C <- rbinom(100000, 1, .7)

# Estimate the probability A, B, and C are all heads
mean( A & B & C )
#0.4*0.2*0.7
```


#### Probability of A or B
$$\mbox{Pr}( A \mbox{ or } B ) = \mbox{Pr}( A ) + \mbox{Pr}( B ) - \mbox{Pr}( A ) \cdot \mbox{Pr}( B )$$
```{r}
A <- rbinom(100000, 1, .5)
B <- rbinom(100000, 1, .5)
mean( A | B )
```

What about more complicated scenarios?  
Three coins:  
$$\mbox{Pr}( A \mbox{ or } B \mbox{ or } C) = \mbox{Pr}( A  \mbox{ and } B) - \mbox{Pr}( A \mbox{ and } C) - \mbox{Pr}( A \mbox{ and } B) + \mbox{Pr}( A \mbox{ and } B \mbox{ and } C )$$
```{r}
A <- rbinom(100000, 1, .5)
B <- rbinom(100000, 1, .5)
C <- rbinom(100000, 1, .5)
mean( A | B | C )
```

```{r}
A <- rbinom(100000, 1, .6)
B <- rbinom(100000, 1, .1)
mean( A | B )
```

```{r}
# Use rbinom to simulate 100,000 draws from each of X and Y
X <- rbinom(100000, 10, .6)
Y <- rbinom(100000, 10, .7)

# Estimate the probability either X or Y is <= to 4
mean(X <= 4 | Y <= 4)

# Use pbinom to calculate the probabilities separately
prob_X_less <- pbinom(4,10,.6)
prob_Y_less <- pbinom(4,10,.7)

# Combine these to calculate the exact probability either <= 4
prob_X_less + prob_Y_less - prob_X_less*prob_Y_less
```


#### Multiplying Random Variables

Rules for manipulating random variables:  

* $E[k\cdot X] = k \cdot E[X]$
* $\mbox{Var}(k \cdot Y) = k^2 \cdot \mbox{Var}(X)$

```{r}
size <- 50
mult <- 4
mean( rbinom( 100000, size, 0.4 ) )
#what happens is the size is increased by 3x
mean( rbinom( 100000, size*mult, 0.4 ) )
```

```{r}
# Simulate 100,000 draws of a binomial with size 20 and p = .1
X <- rbinom(100000, 20, .1)

# Estimate the expected value of X
mean( X )

# Estimate the expected value of 5 * X
mean( 5*X )
```
```{r}
# X is simulated from 100,000 draws of a binomial with size 20 and p = .1
X <- rbinom(100000, 20, .1)

# Estimate the variance of X
var(X)

# Estimate the variance of 5 * X
var(5*X)
```


#### Adding Two Random Variables

$$E[X+Y] = E[X] + E[Y]$$
(even if X and Y are not independent)
$$\mbox{Var}[X+Y] = \mbox{Var}[X] + \mbox{Var}[Y]$$
(only if X and Y are independent)
```{r}
X <- rbinom( 100000, 10, .5 )
Y <- rbinom( 100000, 100, .2 )
Z <- X + Y 

res <- paste( 'E[X]=', mean(X), ',  E[Y]=', mean(Y), '\nE[Z]=', mean(Z), 
       '\nVar[X]=', mean(X), ',  Var[Y]=', mean(Y), '\nVar[Z]=', mean(Z) )

cat( res, sep = '\n')
```

```{r}
X <- rbinom(100000, 20, .3 )
Y <- rbinom(100000, 40, .1 )
mean( X + Y )
```
