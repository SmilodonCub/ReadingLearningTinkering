Notes from videos and exercises. This is a casual follow along to help me remember all the things and to serve as future reference.

## Language of Data

```{r, message= FALSE}
library( openintro )
library( dplyr )
library( ggplot2 )
library( gapminder )
```

```{r}
data( hsb2 )
head( hsb2 )
```
```{r}
str( hsb2 )
```
```{r}
glimpse( hsb2 )
```

```{r}
data( email50 )
str( email50 )
```

### Types of variables
Variable type helps us to determine:

1. What type of summary statistics are needed to describe the data
2. What type of visualizations best represent the data
3. What statistical methods can be applied to the data  

**Numeric (qualitative)**:   

  + **Continuous**: inifite number of values within a given range
  + **Discrete**: specific set of numeric values that can be counted or enumerated, often counted  
  
**Categorical (qualitative)**:  

  + **Ordinal**: finite number of values within a given range, often measured


### Categorical Data

* Is often stored as factors in R
  + factors have an important use in statistical modeling
  + Sometimes factors are undesirable, but sometimes essetial
* Common in subgroup analysis
  + Only interested in a subset of the data
  + Filter for specific levels of categorical variable

```{r}
#frquency tables
table( hsb2$schtyp )
#use dplyr filter to subset the 'public' data
hsb2_public <- hsb2 %>% filter( schtyp == 'public' )
head( hsb2_public )
```

The pipe operator `%>%`:  

  * take the dataframe before the operator and pass to the function following
  * ex: `x %>% f( y )` is effectively `f( x,y )`
  * ex: `sum( 3,4 )` is effectively `3 %>% sum( 4 )`

```{r}
table( hsb2_public$schtyp )
```
The output still shows 'private' as an option even though it does not exist in this subset of the data.
```{r}
#drop unused levels
hsb2_public$schtyp <- droplevels( hsb2_public$schtyp )
table( hsb2_public$schtyp )
```

```{r}
# Subset of emails with big numbers: email50_big
email50_big <- email50 %>%
  filter( number == 'big' )

# Glimpse the subset
#glimpse( email50_big )
table( email50_big$number )
email50_big$number = droplevels( email50_big$number )
table( email50_big$number )
```

### Descretize a variable
redefining a numeric variable as a categorical variable

```{r}
#descretize the average reading score feature as either above or below average
(avg_read <- mean( hsb2$read )) #the extra parentheses will tell R to print the result
```

use dplyr mutate to create a new discrete variable that categorizes a record as being either above or below average reading scores
```{r}
#create new variable: read_cat
hsb2 <- hsb2 %>%
  mutate( read_cat = ifelse(
    read < avg_read,       # <-- logical condition
    'below average',       # <--what to do if condition is TRUE
    'at or above average'  # <--what to do if condition is FALSE
  ))
head( hsb2 )
```

```{r}
# Calculate median number of characters: med_num_char
med_num_char <- median( email50$num_char )

# Create num_char_cat variable in email50
email50_fortified <- email50 %>%
  mutate(num_char_cat = ifelse(num_char < med_num_char, 'below median', "at or above median" ))
  
# Count emails in each category
email50_fortified %>%
  count(num_char_cat)
```

```{r}
# Create number_yn column in email50
email50_fortified <- email50 %>%
  mutate(
    number_yn = case_when(
      # if number is "none", make number_yn "no"
      number == "none" ~ "no", 
      # if number is not "none", make number_yn "yes"
      number != "none" ~ "yes"  
    )
  )
  

# Visualize the distribution of number_yn
ggplot(email50_fortified, aes(x = number_yn)) +
  geom_bar()
```

### Visualizing numerical data 

**`ggplot2`**  

* Modern looking hasstle-free plots (don't have to explicitly render legends etc.)
* easy to extend code to multivariate plots
* Iterative construction (can build complex visualizations by adding relatively simple layers)

```{r}
#scatterplot of math vs science scores
ggplot( data = hsb2, aes( x = science, y = math, color = prog ) ) + 
  #layers are separated by '+'
  geom_point() #having the next layer on a new line makes code readable
```

```{r}
# Scatterplot of exclaim_mess vs. num_char
ggplot(email50, aes(x = num_char, y = exclaim_mess, color = factor(spam))) +
  geom_point()
```



## Study types and cautionary tales

### Observational studies and experiments

Types of studies:

* **Observational Study**:
  + Collect data in a way that does not directly interfere with how the data arise
  + Only correlations can be inferred
* **Experiments**:
  + Randomly assign subjects to various treatments
  + Causation can be inferred

In an experiment, variables that migth also contribute to the outcome (confounding variables) are most likely represented equally in the study groups due to random assignment. Therefore, if there is a significant difference found between the averages of the dependent variable, then we can make causal statements.

An example of an observational study:
```{r}
data( gapminder )
glimpse( gapminder )
```

### Random sampling and random assignment

Random....

* **Random Sampling**: 
  + At selection of subjects from population
  + Helps generalizability of results
* **Random Assignment**:
  + At selection of subjects from population
  + helps infer causation from results
  
Scope of Inference

|                    |       Random Assignment      |     No Random Assignment     |                   |
|:------------------:|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------:|:-----------------:|
|   Random Sampling  |    Causal & Generalizable    | Not Causal but Generalizable |   Generalizable   |
| No Random Sampling | Causal but not Generalizable |  Not Causal or Generalizable | Not Generalizable |
|                    |            Causal            |          Not Causal          |                   |

Simpson's paradox: not considering an important variable when studying an effect

```{r}
load( file="ucb_admit.RData" )
head( ucb_admit )
```
```{r}
# Count number of male and female applicants admitted
ucb_admission_counts <- ucb_admit %>%
  count(Gender, Admit)
```

```{r}
#calculate the proportion of males admitted overall
ucb_admission_counts %>%
  # Group by gender
  group_by(Gender) %>%
  # Create new variable
  mutate(prop = n / sum( n )) %>%
  # Filter for admitted
  filter(Admit == "Admitted")
```

```{r}
#now to find the proportions of males and females admitted by department
ucb_admission_counts <- ucb_admit %>%
  # Counts by department, then gender, then admission status
  count(Dept, Gender, Admit)

ucb_admission_counts  %>%
  # Group by department, then gender
  group_by(Dept, Gender) %>%
  # Create new variable
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %>%
  # Filter for male and admitted
  filter(Gender == 'Male', Admit == "Admitted")
```
