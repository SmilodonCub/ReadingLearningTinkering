    "sisyphus_essay = \"\"\"\\nThe gods had condemned Sisyphus to ceaselessly rolling a rock to the top of a mountain, \n",
    "whence the stone would fall back of its own weight. They had thought with some reason that there is no more \n",
    "dreadful punishment than futile and hopeless labor. If one believes Homer, Sisyphus was the wisest and most \n",
    "prudent of mortals. According to another tradition, however, he was disposed to practice the profession of \n",
    "highwayman. I see no contradiction in this. Opinions differ as to the reasons why he became the futile laborer \n",
    "of the underworld. To begin with, he is accused of a certain levity in regard to the gods. He stole their secrets. \n",
    "Egina, the daughter of Esopus, was carried off by Jupiter. The father was shocked by that disappearance and \n",
    "complained to Sisyphus. He, who knew of the abduction, offered to tell about it on condition that Esopus would \n",
    "give water to the citadel of Corinth. To the celestial thunderbolts he preferred the benediction of water. \n",
    "He was punished for this in the underworld. Homer tells us also that Sisyphus had put Death in chains. \n",
    "Pluto could not endure the sight of his deserted, silent empire. He dispatched the god of war, who liberated \n",
    "Death from the hands of her conqueror. It is said that Sisyphus, being near to death, rashly wanted to test \n",
    "his wife\\'s love. He ordered her to cast his unburied body into the middle of the public square. \n",
    "Sisyphus woke up in the underworld. And there, annoyed by an obedience so contrary to human love, he obtained \n",
    "from Pluto permission to return to earth in order to chastise his wife. But when he had seen again the face of \n",
    "this world, enjoyed water and sun, warm stones and the sea, he no longer wanted to go back to the infernal \n",
    "darkness. Recalls, signs of anger, warnings were of no avail. Many years more he lived facing the curve of the \n",
    "gulf, the sparkling sea, and the smiles of earth. A decree of the gods was necessary. Mercury came and seized \n",
    "the impudent man by the collar and, snatching him from his joys, lead him forcibly back to the underworld, where \n",
    "his rock was ready for him. You have already grasped that Sisyphus is the absurd hero. He is, as much through his \n",
    "passions as through his torture. His scorn of the gods, his hatred of death, and his passion for life won him \n",
    "that unspeakable penalty in which the whole being is exerted toward accomplishing nothing. This is the price \n",
    "that must be paid for the passions of this earth. Nothing is told us about Sisyphus in the underworld. \n",
    "Myths are made for the imagination to breathe life into them. As for this myth, one sees merely the whole \n",
    "effort of a body straining to raise the huge stone, to roll it, and push it up a slope a hundred times over; \n",
    "one sees the face screwed up, the cheek tight against the stone, the shoulder bracing the clay-covered mass, \n",
    "the foot wedging it, the fresh start with arms outstretched, the wholly human security of two earth-clotted hands. \n",
    "At the very end of his long effort measured by skyless space and time without depth, the purpose is achieved. \n",
    "Then Sisyphus watches the stone rush down in a few moments toward tlower world whence he will have to push it \n",
    "up again toward the summit. He goes back down to the plain. It is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus \n",

    "settled among men. All Sisyphus\\' silent joy is contained therein. His fate belongs to him. His rock is a thing. \n",
    "Likewise, the absurd man, when he contemplates his torment, silences all the idols. In the universe suddenly \n",

    "shadow, and it is essential to know the night. The absurd man says yes and his efforts will henceforth be \n",
    "unceasing. If there is a personal fate, there is no higher destiny, or at least there is, but one which he \n",
    "concludes is inevitable and despicable. For the rest, he knows himself to be the master of his days. At that \n",
    "subtle moment when man glances backward over his life, Sisyphus returning toward his rock, in that slight \n",
    "pivoting he contemplates that series of unrelated actions which become his fate, created by him, combined \n",
    "under his memory\\'s eye and soon sealed by his death. Thus, convinced of the wholly human origin of all that \n",

    "still rolling. I leave Sisyphus at the foot of the mountain! One always finds one\\'s burden again. \n",
    "But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is \n",
    "well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, \n",
    "each mineral flake of that night filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights \n",

    "forbes = '\\nThe idea is to create more transparency about companies and individuals that are breaking the law or are non-compliant with official obligations and incentivize the right behaviors with the overall goal of improving governance and market order. The Chinese Communist Party intends the social credit score system to “allow the trustworthy to roam freely under heaven while making it hard for the discredited to take a single step.” Even though the system is still under development it currently plays out in real life in myriad ways for private citizens, businesses and government officials. Generally, higher credit scores give people a variety of advantages. Individuals are often given perks such as discounted energy bills and access or better visibility on dating websites. Often, those with higher social credit scores are able to forgo deposits on rental properties, bicycles, and umbrellas. They can even get better travel deals. In addition, Chinese hospitals are currently experimenting with social credit scores. A social credit score above 650 at one hospital allows an individual to see a doctor without lining up to pay.\\n'\n",
    "harvard_law = '\\nIn his important new book, The Schoolhouse Gate: Public Education, the Supreme Court, and the Battle for the American Mind, Professor Justin Driver reminds us that private controversies that arise within the confines of public schools are part of a broader historical arc — one that tracks a range of cultural and intellectual flashpoints in U.S. history. Moreover, Driver explains, these tensions are reflected in constitutional law, and indeed in the history and jurisprudence of the Supreme Court. As such, debates that arise in the context of public education are not simply about the conflict between academic freedom, public safety, and student rights. They mirror our persistent struggle to reconcile our interest in fostering a pluralistic society, rooted in the ideal of individual autonomy, with our desire to cultivate a sense of national unity and shared identity (or, put differently, our effort to reconcile our desire to forge common norms of citizenship with our fear of state indoctrination and overencroachment). In this regard, these debates reflect the unique role that both the school and the courts have played in defining and enforcing the boundaries of American citizenship. \\n'\n",
    "r_digest = '\\nThis week 30 passengers were reportedly injured when a Turkish Airlines flight landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport encountered turbulent conditions. Injuries included bruises, bloody noses, and broken bones. In mid-February, a Delta Airlines flight made an emergency landing to assist three passengers in getting to the nearest hospital after some sudden and unexpected turbulence. Doctors treated 15 passengers after a flight from Miami to Buenos Aires last October for everything from severe bruising to nosebleeds after the plane caught some rough winds over Brazil. In 2016, 23 passengers were injured on a United Airlines flight after severe turbulence threw people into the cabin ceiling. The list goes on. Turbulence has been become increasingly common, with painful outcomes for those on board. And more costly to the airlines, too. Forbes estimates that the cost of turbulence has risen to over $500 million each year in damages and delays. And there are no signs the increase in turbulence will be stopping anytime soon.\\n'\n",

The key to changing your diet is to start small. “Small changes in sodium in foods are not usually noticed,” Quader says. Eventually, she adds, the effort will reset a kid’s taste buds so the salt cravings stop. Bridget Murphy is a dietitian at New York University’s Langone Medical Center. She suggests kids try adding spices to their food instead of salt. Eating fruits and veggies and cutting back on packaged foods will also help. Need a little inspiration? Murphy offers this tip: Focus on the immediate effects of a diet that is high in sodium. High blood pressure can make it difficult to be active. “Do you want to be able to think clearly and perform well in school?” she asks. “If you’re an athlete, do you want to run faster?” If you answered yes to these questions, then it’s time to shake the salt habit.\\n'\n",

    "blog = '\\nTwenty-first-century politics has witnessed an alarming rise of populism in the U.S. and Europe. The first warning signs came with the UK Brexit Referendum vote in 2016 swinging in the way of Leave. This was followed by a stupendous victory by billionaire Donald Trump to become the 45th President of the United States in November 2016. Since then, Europe has seen a steady rise in populist and far-right parties that have capitalized on Europe’s Immigration Crisis to raise nationalist and anti-Europe sentiments. Some instances include Alternative for Germany (AfD) winning 12.6% of all seats and entering the Bundestag, thus upsetting Germany’s political order for the first time since the Second World War, the success of the Five Star Movement in Italy and the surge in popularity of neo-nazism and neo-fascism in countries such as Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland and Austria.\\n'\n",
