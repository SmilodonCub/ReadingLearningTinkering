    "Just as we as human beings also corporations/businesses as entities exist in the flux of social and environment turmoil around us. And as the size and complexity of corporations scales upwards -we live in an era where some corporations' finances dwarf that of small nation states- it is necessary for corporations/businesses to recognize thier impact on the world -be that the environment and/or community- around them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "business does not exist in a vacuum.  \n",
    "it is now more important than ever to incorporate environmental and social concerns not only into the business plan, but to internalize the same values within the internal governance of the organization.  \n",
